# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-with-Linear-Regression

## Summary

This repository contains a Python project using Jupyter Notebook to explore and predict real estate prices based on various factors. 
The dataset includes house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, longitude, and house price per unit area.

## Key Findings

No strong linear relationship between house age and price
Strong negative relationship between distance to MRT station and house price
Positive relationship between number of convenience stores and house price
Latitude and longitude show weak correlations with house price

## Correlation Analysis

House Age: weak negative correlation (-0.01)
Distance to Nearest MRT Station: strong negative correlation (-0.64)
Number of Convenience Stores: moderate positive correlation (0.28)
Latitude and Longitude: weak correlations (0.08 and -0.10)

## Linear Prediction

The model makes reasonably accurate predictions for a significant portion of the test set
Some points deviate significantly from the actual values

## Histograms

House Age: relatively uniform distribution with a slight increase in newer properties
Distance to Nearest MRT Station: most properties are close to an MRT station
Number of Convenience Stores: wide range with notable peaks at specific counts
Latitude and Longitude: relatively concentrated distributions
House Price of Unit Area: right-skewed distribution with a concentration of properties in the lower price range
Code
The Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for data exploration, visualization, correlation analysis, linear prediction, and histogram plots.

## Conclusion

Real Estate Price Prediction aims to provide accurate property rates for informed decision-making in real estate transactions.
This analysis provides insights into the factors influencing house prices, aiding buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals.
